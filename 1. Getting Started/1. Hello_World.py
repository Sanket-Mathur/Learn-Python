"""
Let's start with a little hello world program, but before that let me introduce to comments.
Comments are parts of program that are ignored by the compiler and are often used for documenting code.
There are 2 types of comments i.e. single line comments and multiple line comments.
The one you are seeing now are multiple line comments while the single line comments starts with a #.
Now talking about our hello world program, python does not require any external libraries for it's basic functionality.
You can simply print something onto the console using the print() function.
"""

print('Hello World')

"""
Here we are enclosing the string hello world in single quotes which is a strange behaviour if you're familiar with other languages.
However, Python allows you to use either single quotes or double quotes for strings.
If you don't know any language yet and don't know what a string is, don't worry, we are going to look at data types in our next file.
